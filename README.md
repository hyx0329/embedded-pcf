# embedded-psf

A toy lib loading X11 Portable Compiled Font for embedded-graphics.

`no-std` is currently WIP.

It's not a complete implementation. Some PCF fonts may not be supported.

## Motivation

I want to use bitmap fonts like what it does [on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bitmap_Font).

## Notes

This project only aims to read the glyphs in PCF fonts and interface with embedded-graphics.
Not all features are implemented.
